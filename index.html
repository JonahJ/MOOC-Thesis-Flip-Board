        <p>We know that people click some places more than others in online learning environments; this research aims to uncover where these clicks happen in the context of the web page and propose why. This explorative research study brings student activity data beyond excel spreadsheets by conducting wireframing exercises and 3-D mapping onto the visual design of the online learning environment. Platforms covered in this study include edX, Coursera, Lynda, Khan Academy, Duolingo, Blackboard, Udacity, and a custom platform built specifically for one course. I borrow from a number of fields including graphic design, web design, interaction design, user experience, and instructional design.</p>

    <section class="thesis-content" id="wireframe-exercise">
        <h3>Wireframe Exercise</h3>
        <p>Wireframe exercises explore if and how the content of the page relates to its grid layout and infrastructure. This type of exercise answers questions pertaining to the page layout's usability, legibility, and relevance to the content embedded within it (Watzman, 2003).</p>
        <div class="interactive"></div>
        <p>Through separating a page's form from its content, wireframe analyses reveal what a page's form affords. When I refer to "form," I am referring to the grid and structure upon which the page is built. The question at hand in this analysis is whether or not each platform's form is suitable for its content. The following animation provides an overview comparison of all the wireframes.</p>
        <p>The wireframe analysis serves as a proof of concept for the need for edX to either rationalize or alter their design in some capacity. When comparing it to its competition its complexity and confusing interface become magnified. This is not to say that other platforms have mastered the design of online learning environments. None of them are perfect, but some are more effective and useful than others. I cannot fathom what a perfect design would look like. Great design is not about reaching perfection. It is about optimizing the learning experience to the best of our ability given what we know.</p>

        <h3>Weekly Clicks</h3>
        <p>I created this by visualizing the course's click data with the 3D modeling program called Blender. I was compelled to create this visualization upon realizing that two-dimensional representations of this data are limiting in their ability to communicate a meaningful narrative of the data. This animation shows the translation of the same data set from the two-dimensional line graph that is traditionally used to represent this type of data to the three-dimensional rendering. This allows the viewer to derive the same information as the traditional graph while simultaneously processing this information within the context of the visual appearance of the web page.</p>

    <section class="thesis-content" id="clicks-per-unit-type">
        <h3>Clicks Per Unit Type</h3>
        <p>In the edX platform, there are three different unit types within each subsection: text, video, and problem. This analysis examines the intersection of student motivation and platform iconography design of the buttons students click to access each unit type.</p>
        <p>The text unit types are represented by an icon depicting a piece of paper with the upper right hand corner of it folded over . The type units are composed of only text and images and are usually used in order to preface and provide context for the ensuing video lectures, readings, and quizzes. It is possible for one unit to house a quiz question, text, and a video. In this event, the problem icon would show in the subsections unit bar.</p>
        <div class="interactive"></div>
        <p>In no particular order, I propose the three most plausible reasons that could have lead to the high number of clicks on the problem buttons in GeorgetownX's Globalization's Winners and Losers course.</p>
        <p>One potential reason that the problem units were clicked on so much more frequently than the others is that upon entering a given subsection, students would immediately jump directly to the problem units in order to try to complete the course, or gain a total course score of 75%, as quickly as possible. These students did not want watch any of the video lectures or perusing the course readings; they just wanted to get that 75%, get the certificate, and get out.</p>
        <p>Another possible explanation for the high frequency of clicks on the problem buttons is that students would jump directly to the problem units in order to find out what information they should be looking out for as they explore the section's video lectures and readings. This would create context for them and prime their mind regarding what information they should especially attend to.</p>
        <p>The high frequency of problem button clicks could also be the result of students repeatedly leaving and returning to the quiz page to search back through the video lectures and readings for the answers.</p>
        <p>I see the high frequency of problem/quiz unit visits as a proof of concept for an overhaul of the edX quiz interface. As it stands now, the quiz pages are dull--all white background with dark grey text. Since the student activity data expresses a special interest for these pages, course and platform designers should react to this and design more interactive, engaging assessment environments and explore the possibilities for formative assessments that students can learn from--and maybe even enjoy.</p>

    <section class="thesis-content" id="navigation-bar">
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <div class="interactive"></div>
        <p>It is to be expected that Course Info has the most page visits, because that is the landing page every student sees when he or she enters the course for a new session. Regardless of where they are coming from--an email, edX dashboard, external link, etc.--this will always be the first page a student sees. So from the perspective of seeing this data as page loads, this makes perfect sense, as the loading of the course info page is prerequisite to the opening of any subsequent pages.</p>
        <p>Courseware is the second most visited of the navigation bar pages, as this is where the vast majority of course content resides. Students must enter the courseware section to complete the two most important tasks in the Globalization course: watch the video lectures and take the quizzes.</p>
        <p>The third most visited page in the navigation bar is the Progress page. This is the students expression (through their activity data) of a need and desire to receive more clarity of their place within the course--with regards to both the larger concepts the course works towards and the students own progress in the form of their final grades. The button itself is unclear as to where it will bring students or what information it will tell them. It simply reads "Progress." In the context of open learning, where students work towards a certificate of arbitrary social and professional value, I was surprised the first time I clicked that link to be brought to a place that showed me the progression of my grade in the course. I was hoping (and still am to this day) for a visualization or representation of my progress through the course in the form of a mental/concept/cognitive map of sorts that showed me all that I had learned and where I was heading in the learning experience, such as that offered in Khan Academy.</p>

    <section class="thesis-content" id="topography">
        <h3>Topography</h3>
        <p>Below is a three-dimensional topographic simulation and rendering of the click activity on an average page in GeorgetownX's Globalization's Winners and Losers course.</p>
        <div class="interactive"></div>
        <p>I created the three-dimensional representations of the click data without knowing or guessing what type of story it would tell or trends it might reveal. I decided to create it with two simple questions in mind: is it possible, and, if so, will it be useful? The answer to both questions is now clearly a resounding "Yes." The result of this exploratory research enables multiple avenues of future research, as outlined above. Of the many possible uses for that visualization to stand out as especially promising: one I will call "Individual Topography" and the other "Page-by-Page." An Individual Topography application of this data visualization method would reveal an individual student's engagement with the course through his or her most commonly clicked features. An individual topography could be used as a tool of grading or a tool for self-regulation. If a student or professor notices certain buttons/sections/types of content being neglected in his or her data, they can act on that and pay more attention to those. A Page-by-Page application of this data visualization would reveal where students tend to go/click on a given page. If an instructor were to see a particular page in the course leading to a place he or she did not want the students going, like backwards, that could be a sign that the instructor needs to intervene and clarify something for the students.</p>
        <p>While we will never be able to control or predict all of the millions of clicks that happen in online learning environments, developing effective data collection and visualizations will at least shed some light on where interventions and improvements need to be made in the course design. Understanding the source of motivation and the demand/need for online education will allow course and platform designers alike to create a better product that optimizes the online learning experience based on a wholesome understanding of student motivation and behavior.</p>
